# Cards Simulator

## Very small Project for the Elixir Programming Bootcamp on Udemy with Stephen Grider

This Projects is a card simulator. It can generate a deck of cards with or without jokers and produce certain functionality to those cards such as shuffle the cards, find out if the deck contains a certain card, deal the cards, shuffle and draw the cards, and finally save the cards to file and open a file containing rows of cards!
